        <p style="margin:40px;">This is the greatest video game that has ever been made. This game is the definition of
            a <em><b>Philip Hyatt Certified Masterpiece</b></em>. I could fill books with all my thoughts on this game,
            but I will spare you the excess. The one common complaint I hear about this game from Elder Scrolls fans is
            that the world it takes place in seems to be toned down compared to past games’ descriptions of the province
            of Skyrim. I disagree with this because it is an accurate representation of Skyrim at this point in history.
            Yes Skyrim was very different and much wilder in the earlier eras, but by the 4th Era it has been tamed and
            imperialized. This was the story the writers and developers wanted to tell and I personally like it a lot.
            Watching the followers of old customs witness their world shift around them into a homogenized nation,
            struggling to adapt with modernization while holding on to their ancestral identity is an extremely
            compelling background narrative. The story of Alduin, seen through glimpses of Merethic Era ancient Nord
            history is one of vainglory and corruption. A divine child ordained by the highest beings as a god, only to
            settle for being a dictator out of a lust for power. This was succeeded by Harkon’s twisted attempt to give
            his disenfranchised people new power. As Alduin hungered for control of the Earth, Harkon sought domination
            over the sun. Then once your heroic acts have spread tales of your feats, you must ward off the challengers
            to your prowess. A past Dragonborn backed by a god and a mysterious ebony warrior provide some of the
            toughest challenges yet. The Elder Scrolls has the greatest lore of any fictional universe and this game is
            the supreme example of this. A quick visit to the website, The Imperial Library, will show that real life
            archives could be filled with all the tales and knowledge held within the confines of this game. Perhaps my
            favorite aspect of the game is that I am always finding something new. I have been playing this game
            consistently for over a decade, logged thousands of hours, and had dozens of characters. Yet still, I am
            regularly finding missions I have never done before, features I have never noticed, or enemies I have never
            encountered. That is what makes this game the best ever.</p>
