        <p style="margin:40px;">This follow-up to the smash hit that was Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare proved to be
            even better and is the first game to ever be deemed a <em><b>Philip Hyatt Certified Masterpiece</b></em>. I
            do not give out this award lighty. Only a handful of games have ever even been considered. Obviously, no
            game will be perfect, but my belief is that if it is much of a debate, then it is not a masterpiece.
            However, when it comes to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, I cannot even envision the argument against it. I
            fully believe that this is easily the best small-scale (as in map and lobby size) shooter of all time and
            I’d go as far as to say the best FPS game of all time. In terms of multiplayer experiences, this game is one
            of the most fun ever. It struck the perfect balance of a game that simultaneously feels realistic and not at
            all goofy, while also being unending arcade-style fun. There were so many little decisions made differently
            about this game than other CODs that make it so much better. Being able to hold two shotguns, one in each
            hand, as a secondary is just plain ridiculous and I love it. People complained a lot about Noob Tubes in
            this game when it came out, but it was honestly super fun and not nearly as bad as people made it sound
            like. Yes, some people would spam, but it was frankly easy to get around which is what this game did good.
            It had wildly effective mechanics, but nothing skilled players could not overcome. On top of that, I would
            add that it also has the best story mode of any FPS ever as well. Finally I’ll wrap up by saying, even
            though the fanbase of this game is remembered for being hyper aggressive and toxic, I think in a way that is
            a good thing. While I of course don't support online attacks or bullying, you can press a single button to
            turn off voice chat at any time. Also having a super enthralled, competitive fanbase means you are doing
            something right.
