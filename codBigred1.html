        <p style="margin:40px;">While doing research to write this game description, I came across a YouTube video of
            COD 2: Big Red One titled, “A D-Day level that isn't a clone of Saving Private Ryan” and I feel that is a
            fairly perfect way to describe the game. It is a classic World War 2 shooter game with a standard World War
            2 story, but somehow it does it without feeling tired and doesn’t make you feel like you have heard this
            story before. Obviously the weapons and graphics leave a lot to be desired, but this era of Call of Duty had
            amazing level design and storytelling. This came out right before they fully caught their stride with games
            like Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but also few games into the series so they knew what they wanted to
            accomplish. I have never played the normal version of Call of Duty 2 so I am not sure how it differs from
            Call of Duty 2: Big Red One. Some on the internet say it's basically the same, some say it’s a “crappy
            expansion” made by Treyarch instead of Infinity Ward. Regardless, I would push back against it being
            “crappy” because while it might not be as polished as the more iconic Call of Duty titles, I would not say
            its lack of flash is not a detraction. I personally prefer something like this game that feels more grounded
            in the real world and history of the war, as opposed to many of the widely-beloved 2000s shooter games like
            Battlefield Bad Company, with cheesy voice acting and over-the-top unrealistic action. While other games
            might have more fun online multiplayer, I have always been more of a fan of 2000s shooter games for their
            story modes. This one has a fun balance of arcade action with realistic combat and objectives.</p>
