        <p style="margin:40px;">While I certainly would not consider Big Huge Games a “one hit wonder,” I do personally
            believe they never quite topped their very first game. They would go on to pair up with Age of Mythology’s
            Ensemble Studios to make Age of Empires. This was a far more successful franchise, but for me, none of them
            can hold a candle to Rise of Nations. I do enjoy newer strategy games like Crusader Kings that allow you to
            delve into all aspects of ruling like politics, complex resource management, internal domestic conflict, and
            lifespan of rulers. But something is just so enjoyable about this game that is essentially just a war and
            conquest simulator. This is so close to being a <em><b>Philip Hyatt Certified Masterpiece</b></em> that it
            pains me not to give it, but I do believe if it is a debate, then it is not a masterpiece. Still, there are
            so many reasons I love this game I am not sure where to even start. First off, the soundtrack has to be in
            my top 3 favorites ever. I went for a close to 8 year gap as a kid of not playing this game from around age
            7 or 8 to about 15 years old and was still regularly whistling the OST for that entire break. Once I got
            back into it at an older age, I had even more appreciation for the music, gameplay mechanics, and level of
            detail. That appreciation has only grown deeper as I have aged into my 20s. Another reason I love this game
            is the playable nations that the developers picked. Every game has the Chinese and Romans of course, but I
            cannot think of another where you can play as the Bantu or Lakota if you choose. As a fan of history, I get
            annoyed that media often only focuses on official nations, which often excludes societies that might not
            have technically been a recognized country, but were still a more than formidable foe. Strategy games
            typically only let you pick from a group of well-known European and Asian nations. Few, if any, besides Rise
            of Nations, allows you to be the Nubians or Inca. </p>
