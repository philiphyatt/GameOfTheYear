        <p style="margin:40px;">Star Wars Battlefront II emerged as a phoenix from the ashes of its predecessor,
            triumphantly shedding the ill-fated microtransactions that marred its initial release. The game's
            transformation is nothing short of remarkable, marked by a shift in style that sets it apart from its
            predecessor and its contemporaries. The first installment of this new series laid down the foundation, yet
            it felt like a mere proof of concept compared to the sequel. Although it doesn't fully exploit the potential
            of the new style, the game still succeeds in standing on its own. However, amid the innovative strides, some
            missteps are evident. The selection of heroes and villains, along with their integration into the game's
            system, leaves room for improvement. To put it bluntly, nobody wants BB-8 or Iden Versio (no hate, I loved
            the story mode), we want Ki-Adi-Mundi, Mace Windu, Kit Fisto, Shaak Ti, Jango Fett, etc. Yeah they might
            have played similar to other characters, but this ain't Overwatch. Where Battlefront II truly shines is in
            the experience it offers as an individual soldier on the sprawling battlefield. This iteration amplifies the
            sensation of impact, surpassing its predecessors in some ways. The feeling of being just another face in the
            ranks, reminiscent of the old games, persists, but with the added thrill of potentially rising to prominence
            and changing the course of the battle. One of my favorite parts of the game that is rarely praised is its
            atmospheric flying combat, best exemplified on planets like Kashyyyk. The sheer exhilaration of dogfights
            amidst iconic landscapes demonstrates the developers' dedication to bringing the Star Wars universe to life.
            Vehicle combat is equally engaging, delivering on its promise of epic battles. The introduction of new game
            modes adds depth to the multiplayer experience, elevating the overall gameplay. Yet, a lingering sentiment
            remains that the developers could have prolonged the stream of fresh content, enhancing the longevity of the
            game. </p>
