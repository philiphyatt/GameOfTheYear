        <p style="margin:40px;">When talking about the best horror games of all time, the conversation will surely be
            dominated by third-person survival horrors like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. However, I’ve always
            preferred the first-person ones, even though the vast majority are unplayable garbage. This game is what
            every horror game should strive to be. This game is one of the only genuinely scary horror games I’ve played
            and it kept me locked in throughout the entire game. I played through this game in one night with some
            friends the first time I played it. That is how captivating it is. (I think there was later content released
            that I didn't play though, I’m just talking about the original game.) All the intrigue and horror comes from
            the extremely unique and mind-bending mechanic of the hallways constantly changing anytime you turn away. It
            was implemented so well and blew me away when I first witnessed it. It felt like being stuck in one of the
            craziest horror movies you have ever seen and being forced to make your way through the terror. In a good
            way though. Witnessing reality shift around you whenever you turn your back leaves you with a deep sense of
            dread and helplessness against whoever or whatever your enemy is. It is a different type of horror than say,
            a game like Outlast. Blood and guts no, psychological torture yes. And lastly, I’ll say that while I do
            think the aesthetic is really cool, when it comes to a sequel, I hope to see one in a completely different
            setting. Getting lost on an ever changing spaceship would be very different, but awesome. </p>
