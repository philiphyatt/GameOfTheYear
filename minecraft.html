        <p style="margin:40px;">The 2011 project that was originally titled, “Cave Game” is just one of those video
            games where there is nothing quite like it. It has countless copycats and wanna-bes, but almost no actual
            competition. It could be argued Roblox is the only game that has even come close, but Roblox is a free game.
            Minecraft has remained far more popular over the years, even while sitting behind a paywall and having much
            less content. If you don’t play on servers, there are only 3 gamemodes and 2 of them are almost the complete
            same. Minecraft is the classic game where months or years will go by where you don’t touch it, only for you
            to dive in deeper than ever before one eventual day. It is the friend of all slow family vacations and
            boring Winter Breaks. Now the experience that is Minecraft servers is honestly a whole other world and more
            comparable to something like Roblox. While I played things like Spleef, Survival Games, and The Walls as a
            kid, as I got older I started only playing normal survival with friends so I will focus this review on that
            aspect of the game. The multiplayer has evolved greatly since my retirement from it, so I am not sure I am
            the best source. But when it comes to vanilla Minecraft, I have played it immensely and what is funny about
            it is that I am basically just doing the same stuff over and over again. Spawn, build a house, farm, go
            mining, get iron, dig deeper, get diamonds, go to the Nether, go to the End, repeat. However, it only
            temporarily gets old. With many of my favorite games ever, I now get bored after a few minutes because I
            have done everything. Minecraft's greatest strength is not having that feeling. </p>
