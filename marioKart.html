        <p style="margin:40px;">This was just one of those games that for a decade after it came out, it felt like
            literally everyone you knew had played it. Everyone either owned it, their grandma owned it, their stepdad
            owned it, their aunt owned it, or they played it at their friends house. This bad boy popped out at every
            sleepover, birthday party, and family function. I’m sure the mainline Mario Bros games put up better numbers
            worldwide, but amongst my age group in the United States, I am confident this is Nintendo’s most popular
            game yet. Franchises like Pokemon and Smash in general might have been played more, but Mario Kart Wii was
            their most popular individual game amongst people I knew. This might sound like a backhanded compliment, but
            I would say this game’s greatest strength is the low level of skill needed to play and still be decent. I
            understand it is realistic, but so many racing games are far too complex and difficult for me and I have
            been playing games my whole life. They are completely unplayable for someone who is newer to video games.
            However with this game, virtually anyone can hop on and have fun. I have played Mario Kart Wii with people
            who it was their first time playing a video game and they still were able to keep up and enjoy themselves.
            Some might not like this, but I think it is just a different vibe than Assetto Corsa or F1. Those games are
            for being hyper-competitive, which is fun, but just not my vibe with racing games. The goal of Mario Kart
            Wii is not to achieve record-breaking times, but to just to have fun with friends.</p>
