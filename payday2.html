        <p style="margin:40px;">While the vast majority of crime games are new spins on the Grand Theft Auto format, I
            respect Overkill Software for going in a completely new direction with their franchise. There is nothing
            quite like Payday, so the model was theirs to create and improve. The second game was definitely an
            improvement over the first, but the developers also worked on content to raise the quality of the second
            even after its release. Heists that were released later had move abilities to plan out how you wanted to
            take it on and allowed you to store equipment beforehand. However, even the original missions have dozens of
            different ways to play them. Obviously there are two main ways: stealth or guns-blazing. But amongst stealth
            there are many different types such as ECM rushes, intimidation plays, or even running it by yourself and
            slowly picking off guards one by one while the AI sits back and watches. Same is true for going loud. The
            game provides tons of different strategies and in my experience, the community is amazing. Players are
            almost always communicative and down for whatever approach is suggested. And even the occasional noob
            doesn’t usually screw it up for everyone. The weapons in this game are phenomenal, with countless options
            and attachments. I prefer this game’s more classic COD-style DLC with new content coming in large packs you
            can buy instead of the CS:GO-style crate system which has taken over gaming. My one complaint with this game
            was that the later heists were a little over the top for my taste. I preferred the more straightforward bank
            robberies. Besides that though, I really enjoyed all the later content added. Being able to rob the GO Bank
            as John Wick or Hila Klein was just so awesome.</p>
