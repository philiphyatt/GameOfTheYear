        <p style="margin:40px;">There are many city planner and simulator games out there, but for a long time, SimCity
            4 was the gold standard. SimCity was of course, made by Maxis, the sim gods. Maxis is well known for
            creating The Sims, My Sims, SimAnt, SimCopter, SimEarth, etc. Two things this game is great at providing are
            options and details. There is God Mode, where you can terraform and craft the world into whatever location
            you want for your city. There is also Mayor Mode, where it is on you to manage your city in all aspects. You
            are required to manage resources and tend to your citizensâ€™ needs. These are fairly rudimentary abilities
            for city simulator games, but of course the creators of The Sims franchise would allow you to take control
            of and observe individual citizens throughout the course of their lives. They could die from natural
            disasters or from poor play on your part and it made the game feel much more lived in. This game also does
            not look half bad which is always a plus for games that came out before 2010. Previous city simulator games
            were almost all two dimensional rendering. SimCity 4 stepped the game up with completely three dimensional
            rendering that was legitimately high tech for the time. This meant when it originally came out, it did not
            always run the best on the average computer. Now, SimCity 4 is more enjoyable than ever since it runs
            extremely fast on modern systems. It is amazing to me that a game that is so technically based can still
            compete with its descendents and competition decades after its release.</p>
