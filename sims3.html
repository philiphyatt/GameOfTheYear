        <p style="margin:40px;">This is one of the few games I can think of where after a certain point, I myself, came
            to the realization that I was playing it far too much and it was time to move on. I was obsessed with The
            Sims 3 from the first time I ever played at my cousin’s house in 2009, to around halfway through high
            school. It was honestly just too much fun and too addictive. I would spend weeks just sitting in the kitchen
            of my parents’ house playing this game non-stop. Sometime in high school I made the decision that as much as
            it pained me, it was time to retire from The Sims 3. Even though I was only around 16, I felt that I was
            getting to the age where I should probably be working on my own real life, instead of virtual ones. If
            someone told me my time playing The Sims 3 dwarfs all the other amounts of time I’ve spent on games, I would
            not be surprised at all. Obviously, you can tell from this website I have a deep love for video games. I
            have always pushed back against the narratives that video games are a waste of time or not as valuable of an
            experience as hanging out with friends in real life. However, especially when it comes to a life simulator,
            you get to a point where it's time to hang up the hat. While this all might sound like a condemnation, I
            mean it as the highest form of compliment. This game was so fun I had to reevaluate the direction my life
            was heading, not many games can say that.
