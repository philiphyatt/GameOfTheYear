        <p style="margin:40px;">While I believe the game was truly completed with The Titans expansion that came out in
            2003, Age of Mythology initially debuted in 2002 for Microsoft Windows. The actual mechanics of the game are
            fairly standard with other similar titles like Age of Empires, but this product offers a magical twist that
            really works in a fun way. Ensemble Studio, the creators of Age of Mythology, actually are one of the
            various studios that helped develop the Age of Empires games. This game is a spinoff of that series and it
            is very clear from the second you start playing. Most things are set up somewhat similar and the game plays
            almost the same. That is, until you start releasing colossal primordial titans to take out squads of troops
            with single blows. That is what you are playing this game for. The story is fairly forgettable, yet that is
            typical for early 2000s military strategy games. What is not typical about this game is being able to use
            legendary gods and mythical creatures to make the battles even more chaotic. The scenario creator is where
            this game shines the brightest. Being able to pit armies of hoplites against beings like Kronos and Gaia is
            a level of god-like fun that many games have attempted to create like Totally Accurate Battle Simulator and
            the Fallout 4 Wasteland Workshop DLC. Of course, with a game this old the graphics look fairly dated, but
            the animations still look great and I love the art direction. It is that perfect 2000s, over the top Greek
            mythology. As if the 2010 Clash of the Titans movie was a video game. </p>
