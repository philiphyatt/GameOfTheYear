        <p style="margin:40px;">Initially, I was skeptical, I feared this was the reanimated corpse of Black Ops 1 being
            puppeted around to drum up cheap nostalgia-based hype. However, over time, my reservations gave way to an
            appreciation for its unique aesthetic and captivating time period. While sharing a similar era with BO1,
            Cold War presented a fresh perspective, showcasing a different facet of history. My only qualm was with the
            game's title. The lingering "Black Ops" label felt like an attempt to exploit a well-known name, rather than
            letting this installment carve out its own identity. This overshadowed the game's potential and diluted its
            uniqueness. It became clear that the franchise had oversaturated the Black Ops brand. Despite this, the
            multiplayer combat was a highlight that I thoroughly enjoyed. The gameplay bore a striking resemblance to an
            80s spins on 2019's Modern Warfare, a facet I found particularly appealing. The inclusion of well-crafted
            maps and an arsenal of impressive weaponry further heightened the experience. Gear and armaments in COD can
            often feel like the state of the art, cutting-edge side of military technology. It was nice to have a game
            with more straightforward grenades and machine guns. I thoroughly enjoyed the Zombies mode in this COD
            installment. The maps were amazing, both the smaller, classic-style ones and the massive ones that added a
            whole new feel to COD Zombies. This duality catered to diverse preferences, showcasing the game's
            versatility. While I didn't make it through the entirety of the story, it's widely acknowledged that Black
            Ops Cold War set itself apart with its engaging narrative, featuring multiple endings based on player
            performance. This unique approach added depth and complexity to the Call of Duty franchise, diverging from
            the norm. The persistent issue of the battle pass remained, which I personally wasn't a fan of. However, the
            subsequent content releases managed to redeem this aspect, offering substantial and engaging additions to
            the game. In many ways, this felt like the most classic Call of Duty in a while. </p>
