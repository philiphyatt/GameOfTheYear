        <p style="margin:40px;">One of the things that Blue Fang Games did best with this absolute work of art was the
            DLC that came after the initial release. Obviously most of this came out after 2004, but regardless, being
            able to have a zoo of dinosaurs and other extinct animals really made this game unique. I had so much fun as
            a kid releasing them on unsuspecting visitors. The aquarium expansion was also extremely fun and added a
            whole new element to the game. That is something that is not often seen with expansion packs and other DLC.
            However, we have only begun to scratch the surface of this gameâ€™s greatness. Another reason the game is so
            good is the concept itself. No virtual business has ever been more fun for me to run than a zoo. With most
            other business simulators like Rollercoaster Tycoon, you are just managing the wants and needs of your
            guests. With zoos, you are both managing the wants and needs of your guests and your animals. The
            attractions themselves require the most care and attention. This is what really sets the game apart as more
            engaging than the competition. Overall, I think Zoo Tycoon 2 is the best business simulation or tycoon game
            of all time. It is a shame that the creators were not able to keep it up and build upon what they
            established. I had so much hype for Zoo Tycoon 3, but all the future games I played felt cheap and soulless.
            I often wish they would just go back and modernize the second game, though it is still a ton of fun to play.
