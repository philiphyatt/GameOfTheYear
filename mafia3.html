        <p style="margin:40px;">From now on, if any developer is looking at making a period-based open-world shooter,
            this is the model. As a fan of history, this is how to do it right in gaming. It is not just about depicting
            the era accurately, but picking an era that you can do right. You have to pick a period with defining
            aesthetics, moods, and imagery. When people think of the 1960s American South, racism quickly comes to mind.
            The racial components of this game are done realistically, yet tastefully. Nothing feels corny or Hollywood,
            while also not being overly triggering or offensive to people of color. The documentary overlay throughout
            the game is so well done and something I haven’t really seen in any other game. It makes you feel like such
            a badass and like you really had an impact on the history of the world. I’ve always been a big fan of
            documentaries so these scenes were so damn fun and honestly, gave me chills. There are a few minor parts of
            this game that are a little lackings, but the story alone completely makes up for it. Everything about the
            story is phenomenal. Lincoln Clay is an amazing protagonist, every character has great motives and voice
            acting, there are compelling ups and downs, etc. I love the map, even though the game would benefit from
            more animals and general NPCs. Both the swamp and the city are done perfectly and have an authentic feel
            that can be hard to accomplish. Especially at night, the bayou feels like an area you definitely do not want
            to get lost in. Some people did not like the combat, they complained it felt clunky and rudimentary. I’m not
            sure if I’m in an alternate reality, but I loved it. I thought the gunplay was impactful and satisfying and
            while the stealth was the pretty basic, whistle and takedown format, it was still a lot of fun. Finally, I
            think the boss system was an amazing idea, because it allows for variation in playthroughs of a game that is
            pretty story focused. </p>
