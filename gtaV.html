        <p style="margin:40px;">It almost pains me to say this, but if I add up all my time playing this game, I believe
            it exceeds 3000 hours. A calendar month is around 730 hours. I have played the equivalent to an entire
            season in this game, but I guess I have had over a decade to do so. I can confidently say that GTA V/Online
            is not only a <em><b>Philip Hyatt Certified Masterpiece</b></em>, but also my favorite game of all time. For
            starters, while Online is what I probably spent over 95% of my time on, Grand Theft Auto V has one of the
            best stories in the history of gaming. The acting and dialogue is on par with many crime movies such as
            Scorsese and Taratino flicks. The story itself is memorable and quite long. I have heard the number thrown
            out that there is 100 hours worth of cutscenes alone if you do every single mission. Being able to switch
            between 3 distinct characters at almost any time was an awesome idea by rockstar. GTA Online was one of the
            most unique experiences Iâ€™ve had in gaming. There is nothing quite like it. There were so many different
            amazing aspects to this game it is hard to know where to start. Obviously, the vehicles are the focus and
            this game did it better than any other. The driving mechanics are the perfect balance between realistic and
            fun. For the time, the physics system was quite impressive and there are so many little details like if you
            smash into walls it leaves a mark. The insane amount of vehicles and th variety in terms of how they feel to
            drive/ride/pilot is what never gets old about this game. While the fun of the missions wore off after a
            certain point, just cruising around never gets stale. Not to hate on the missions though. Those and the
            gunplay itself also were great aspects of the game. Finally, I will end with saying the community is one of
            the best in gaming. Yes the joke is everyone is some toxic little kid that will blow you up for no reason,
            but the coolest people I have ever met through gaming were all on GTA V. Car meets, crew server hangouts,
            freemode minigames, etc. Man, those were the times. </p>
