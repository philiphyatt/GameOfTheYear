        <p style="margin:40px;">While I believe Modern Warfare 2 (2009) is the greatest shooter game ever, in a sense, I
            agree with most people’s assessment that Black Ops 2 is the best COD game. That does seem a little
            counterintuitive though, so I will try to explain. Black Ops 2 defined Call of Duty as a franchise. It set
            the tone and standard for all COD-style games moving forward. And I will say, the same thing can be said
            about every FPS PVP game that has come out since its release: isn’t as good as Black Ops 2. I love MW2, but
            I also understand that it being the greatest shooter ever is just my personal opinion. Without a doubt, BO2
            was the most beloved and widely played game in the series. I don’t care that online sources have it listed
            as the 5th most popular COD game, there is no possible way that is correct. If I’m living in a world where
            2017’s Call of Duty: WWII was a bigger deal than BO2, I must have stepped through a portal at some point. I
            guess I have to go find the other Philip Hyatt to battle it out for who’s gaming list is superior. I’m
            getting sidetracked with humor, but hopefully you get the point. This game was a big freaking deal when it
            came out. It has been over a decade since its release, in a franchise with yearly games, and it still is the
            gold standard. One thing this game did right, that is not talked about enough, is its aesthetic. Most other
            CODs either have no unique aesthetic or are overly sci-fi. Black Ops 2 is the perfect amount of original
            material being merged with the real world. If there was ever a game perfectly set up to be remastered, it is
            this one.</p>
