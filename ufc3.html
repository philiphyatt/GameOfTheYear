        <p style="margin:40px;">While UFC 1 & 2 just were not quite it, UFC 3 managed to capture the magic and round out
            the edges of what they were going for as a franchise. And while UFC 4 improved certain minor aspects, it was
            this third installment that truly hit the sweet spot, establishing itself as one of the most satisfying and
            captivating fighting games in recent memory. Unlike its predecessors, UFC 3 perfectly balanced the elements
            that make a fighting game shine. While UFC 4 felt more like an incremental update, refining grappling and
            submission mechanics, UFC 3 stands as a testament to the franchise's potential when the execution is on
            point. This title stands out as a personal favorite among fighting games, delivering a deeply rewarding
            experience that resonates with both hardcore fans and newcomers alike. Besides Mortal Kombat, I never really
            connected with fighting games and I believe it was because they were just too goofy and disconnected from
            reality. The UFC franchise are the first fighting games I have played that actually feel like real life,
            hand-to-hand combat. UFC 3 isn't just an individual pursuit; it shines brightest in the company of friends.
            Competing against buddies is definitely the way to go with this one, like most fighting games. The dynamic
            nature of each fight ensures that no two matches are the same, fostering intense rivalries and memorable
            moments. The roster is a treasure trove of current and classic fighters, offering ample choices for every
            fighting style preference. This variety ensures that players can find a fighter that resonates with their
            preferred tactics, adding another layer of strategy to the gameplay. While NBA 2K's MyCareer might have more
            popularity, UFC's career mode is by far my favorite of any sports game. The journey from an up-and-coming
            fighter to a legendary champion is immersive, challenging, and immensely satisfying. The icing on the cake
            lies in the robust character customization system. Crafting your fighter's appearance and style adds a
            personal touch, making every match a reflection of your choices and identity. You can make your guy into a
            badass, yet realistic, Dagestani brawler or just a straight up anime character.</p>
