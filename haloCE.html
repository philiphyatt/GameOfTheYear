        <p style="margin:40px;">Not much can be said about this truly legendary game that has not been said before
            hundreds of times. It forever changed the gaming industry and has influenced countless other titles. It was
            an instant success and immediately created a die-hard fanbase. Stephen Curran, gaming journalist and video
            game reviewer said it was, “the most important launch game for any console, ever.” The game has received
            dozens of awards from all different media companies, magazines, publications, etc. When the developers at
            Bungie originally started working on the game in 1997, it was a futuristic real-time strategy game. After a
            fair amount of time spent working on the game, they decided to change paths and make the game a third person
            shooter. Eventually, it morphed into the first person shooter we have today and thank god for it. Instead of
            being given a likely generic, late-90s strategy game, we were gifted a ground-breaking FPS. Halo: Combat
            Evolved is often overshadowed by its sequel, Halo 2. The games are fairly similar and the second is credited
            with being more polished and having better multiplayer maps and storyline. However, the original has a
            special place in my heart as a simple, yet perfect low-fantasy, futuristic, arcade-y shooter that few games
            are more fun to play with a group of friends. While the story of the first game is not really much of one,
            especially when compared to later installments, I still think the actual levels are a load of fun to this
            day. And it cannot be overlooked or understated how truly remarkable this game is for spawning such a
            revered franchise.</p>
