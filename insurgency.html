        <p style="margin:40px;">Never have I gone from hating a game so much to thoroughly and completely loving it. As
            someone who grew up playing Call of Duty and Halo, this was an entirely different spin on the idea of a
            first person shooter. In this game, you are nobody significant, special, or even especially skilled. You are
            just a random foot soldier and the game plays as such. You cannot call in any aerial backup or perform
            any unique moves. All you have is your weapon. In other games like COD, ultra-realism means fancy graphics
            and lighting effects. In Insurgency, it means that you can die almost instantly and you get no hitmarkers.
            There is no clear way to know if you indeed got that sniper in the window. You just have to hope you hit
            your shot, approach, and keep your head on a swivel. You are the antithesis of a bullet sponge and that is
            what I did not understand about this game at first. I thought it was overly punitive at the expense of fun.
            However, after a certain point I realized that this was meant to be a completely different experience than a
            COD or Battlefield. I had simply not adopted the right playstyle. The way you are meant to play this game is
            unlike any mainstream shooters from this era. COD often gets compared to movies like Saving Private Ryan and
            Michael Bay flicks with giant, earth-shattering battles and explosions. I would say Insurgency is more Enemy
            at the Gates meets American Sniper. It is a brutal game of scanning cityscapes and desert horizons in search
            of movement. Once you find said movement you fire upon it, hoping not only to see red dust emerge out of it,
            but also that no one scanning your horizon noticed the flash. </p>
