        <p style="margin:40px;">The Modern Warfare revamp emerged as a very much-needed renaissance of the Call of Duty
            franchise. With only a few exceptions, like Advanced Warfare and COD WWII, the series had struggled to
            recapture the brilliance witnessed in the era of games like BO2. This installment ushered in a new dawn,
            setting the stage for a reinvigorated COD experience. Central to the game's transformation was the
            introduction of a new engine that brought forth a seismic shift in the dynamics of movement and combat.
            While the technical intricacies might have eluded some players, the tangible impact was undeniable. The
            novel engine redefined the very essence of gameplay, offering a sensation that was both unfamiliar yet
            exhilarating. It was akin to witnessing a fresh creative force taking over the reins of the franchise and
            steering it in the right direction after a long hiatus of quality. Beyond the technical overhaul, Modern
            Warfare boasted an engaging narrative that served as an entertaining prequel setup for the original trilogy.
            The story line added depth to the existing characters, introduced intriguing new ones, and provided an
            immersive backdrop for the ensuing action. The classic-style multiplayer gamemodes like TDM and Search and
            Destroy, in my view, contended for the title of the best COD multiplayer experience to date. It excelled in
            every facet, from the diversity of phenomenal weaponry and intricately designed maps to the introduction of
            engaging new game modes that kept players coming back for more. While much of the experience was
            commendable, a singular blemish was the introduction of the battle pass system, which garnered its share of
            criticism. Nonetheless, the innovation displayed in crafting the new system warranted appreciation.
            Additionally, Modern Warfare introduced Warzone, which I didn't personally delve into, but credit must be
            given for the bold endeavor that certainly payed off for them and added another dimension to the franchise.
