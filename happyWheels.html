        <p style="margin:40px;">I have to admit, I feel a little bad giving this runner-up spot to Happy Wheels because
            it took the spot previously filled by Fallout New Vegas. It feels wrong to put a fairly small, goofy browser
            game over such a legendary Bethesda title. It's like putting Red Ball above Morrowind, but still I gotta do
            it. This isn’t the “most well made games list,” this is <em><b>The Philip Hyatt Game of The Year Awards</b></em> 
            and I have to be true to myself. 2010 saw a lot of great games released, but besides
            maybe only the Winner for this year’s game of the year award, I played Happy Wheels more than any of them.
            James Bonacci, along with the developer Fancy Force, set out to make a simple, yet cartoonishly gory
            obstacle course game and boy did they knock it out of the park. The finished product was a straightforward
            platformer with the only unique feature being the hilariously fun injury system. Your rider could lose a
            limb, break a bone, or even be completely obliterated which made the stakes higher, but it wasn’t overly
            gross or disturbing. Some might still be put off by the content and brutality of the game, but I would argue
            it is not anything close to a Mortal Kombat game. The other great aspect of this game was it was almost
            entirely community-driven. The developers/admins would pick the best of the best courses to advertise on the
            main page, but they were made by fans and lovers of the game. This democratization of content creation is
            evident through a large percentage of “courses” not even really being races and instead players used the
            provided tools to create almost entirely new game modes.</p>
