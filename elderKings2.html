        <p style="margin:40px;">This is the first "game" on this list that actually is not a game at all, but a total
            conversion mod. For those who might not know, A total conversion mod in gaming refers to a significant
            modification or overhaul of a video game that transforms virtually all aspects of the original game,
            creating an entirely new and distinct experience. Unlike minor mods that might add new content or tweak
            specific elements, a total conversion mod usually aims to reimagine the game entirely. This is one of the
            few exceptions I would make for something that is not a full fledged game making the list. Elder Kings 2
            stands as a testament to the immense creative power of mods, as it takes Crusader Kings 3 and metamorphoses
            it into an entirely new Elder Scrolls experience. This remarkable total conversion mod captures the essence
            of the Elder Scrolls universe with such precision that it effortlessly secures a place in my top three Elder
            Scrolls games, despite its detachment from Bethesda. Immersing myself in Elder Kings 2 was a remarkably
            smooth experience, with its polished execution leaving virtually no room for glitches or hiccups. This mod
            emerges as one of the most comprehensive Elder Scrolls "titles" in terms of lore. Its intricate level of
            detail is nothing short of astounding, offering players an unrivaled opportunity to explore the depths of
            the rich lore that the series has to offer. As a longtime enthusiast of Elder Scrolls lore, Elder Kings 2
            proved to be a wellspring of knowledge, adding a new layer to my understanding of the series' intricacies.
            The depth and breadth of lore woven into this mod are a testament to the dedication of its creators. Much
            credit must also be extended to Crusader Kings 3 for laying the foundation upon which Elder Kings 2
            flourished. The core mechanics adapted from Crusader Kings 3 seamlessly integrate with the Elder Scrolls
            universe, contributing to a gameplay experience that feels both familiar and exhilarating. A defining aspect
            of Elder Kings 2 lies in its portrayal of races, cultures, and nations. The attention to authenticity with
            regards to the Elder Scrolls lore results in a captivating array of choices, each resonating with the
            essence of the series. Picking a different country in EK2 usually results in a wholly distinct playthrough,
            whereas in CK3, it is typically fairly similar. </p>
