        <p style="margin:40px;">I think the only thing wrong in this entire massive game is that driving permanently
            feels like it’s on ice. That might seem like an odd compliment, but few games of this size can be so devoid
            of glitches, plot holes, unfun mechanics, or really any overall detractions. The only glitch I can think of
            is the swingset launch and I sure ain’t complaining. That’s one of the best things in the game. Everything
            in this game works phenomenally: the story, the characters, the gunfights, the missions, the city,
            everything. This game released when I was 6 years old and I still haven’t gotten over it. I’ll probably
            still be hopping on occasionally when GTA VII comes out, assuming that's in my lifetime. I love this game
            for so many reasons, but one of the biggest is what it represents. Grand Theft Auto V took the series in a
            new, flashier direction. The director was no longer Martin Scorsese and was now a little bit more Michael
            Bay. Don’t get me wrong, GTA V is in contention for my favorite game ever, but it just has a different feel.
            It had a different art direction, multiple characters, GTA Online, etc. GTA IV was the last of a dying
            breed. A breed of only four: GTA III, San Andreas, Vice City, and IV. In GTA III and IV, my two favorites of
            this era, you’re just some guy. You’re broke, you barely know anyone, and the only work worth doing is
            crime. In GTA V you’re an international criminal working with spy agencies. I don’t mind that, but I love
            that this game just has that gritty 2000s feel from movies like The Departed and it works so well.</p>
