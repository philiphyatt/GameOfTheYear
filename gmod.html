        <p style="margin:40px;">Gmod was the very first game I ever got on Steam, as opposed to purchasing the classic
            big cardboard PC game box. While I missed having a physical box to stare at the cover art, this marked a
            transition into the modern gaming world for me in many ways. It is kind of funny that GMod and Roblox came
            out in the same year because in a lot of ways they are completely different methods of trying to achieve the
            same thing: a perfect sandbox. Where Roblox made an extremely-basic engine and allowed people to build upon
            it, Garry’s Mod took a beloved, yet mechanically simple game and simply removed all boundaries. In 2004,
            Valve developed and released Half-Life 2. It was a massive success for its mind bending storytelling and is
            widely considered one of the best retro PC games. Then two years later, Gary Newman along with British
            developer, Facepunch Studios, released their sandbox utilizing the engine from Half-Life 2. When it comes to
            playing by yourself in GMod, you can do just about anything you want, as long as it is somewhat grounded in
            the real world. For me though, the multiplayer was always the way to go. Dozens of gamemodes with countless
            servers to choose from. There were so many good ones I am not sure where to even start. I’ve wished for
            years someone would make a standalone game for Trouble in Terrorist Town or Sled Build. TTT honestly might
            be my favorite gamemode of any game ever because not only does every match playout differently, but also the
            game is completely about interacting with others and not grinding to get skins and guns.
