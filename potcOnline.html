        <p style="margin:40px;">If my memory serves, this is the only MMO I have ever played much of, but boy did I play
            it. This came out shortly after the release of the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie and the conclusion
            of the original trilogy. I was a young boy fully juiced up on POTC hype and this game was a dream come true.
            However, do not think this is some crappy movie tie-in game that I just remember fondly because I was a kid.
            This was one of the most impressive games of my life and the fact that it ran perfectly fine on my 2000s
            Dell computers still amazes me to this day. I think it was accomplishable because the graphics are not
            anything special, but still not a detraction. I have no idea how it actually stacks up with other games, but
            this was probably the biggest-feeling open-world game that I have played and the detail is insane. There are
            23 three different islands around the map. A handful are just deserted micro-isles, but they usually have
            something individual about them. Then the rest are fairly large to massive islands that all have a unique
            purpose and vibe. Some are controlled by the Davy Jones’ skeleton army, others are controlled by the British
            or EITC. There are giant towering forts and don’t get me started on the caves. Many islands had insanely
            large, complex systems of caves filled with enemies and giant magical illusions of Davy Jones commanding his
            troops. This added a level of depth to each area that I have not seen in many other games. Finally I have to
            mention that this game also has my favorite in-game events of any that I can remember. I remember standing
            on the beach with my friends and all the other players in the lobby and watching the clouds turn green and
            Davy Jones’ ship round the corner, headed for the harbor, ready for invasion. That is one of my favorite
            gaming memories.
