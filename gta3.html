        <p style="margin:40px;">As the creators of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, Rockstar Games, say on their website,
            “Welcome to Liberty City. Where it all began.” This game is truly where it all started for the iconic GTA.
            Before this point, the Grand Theft Auto games were top-down action adventure games with gameplay that was
            enjoyable, yet shallow. When Grand Theft Auto III came out, it revolutionized the genres of open-world and
            crime games. While the graphics look dated by today’s standards, the ability to drive around and cause chaos
            in a somewhat real urban environment was fun on an unparalleled level. While fans of Grand Theft Auto V who
            go back to GTA III might be put off by the silent protagonist, I personally like it. Back in the day, the
            joke with GTA was that you played as a glorified errand boy. By the time of GTA IV, it got a little
            tiresome, but this game did it perfectly. You are a silent, efficient, and effective criminal that gets the
            job done. You are not Al Pacino’s Scarface, rather Ryan Gosling from Drive. Since the game came out a year
            before I was born, I did not play the originally-released PlayStation 2 version. I ended up not playing this
            game until a decade after its release in 2011, when it was uploaded to the App Store. While many might turn
            their noses up at playing the classic game on a 4th Generation iPod Touch, it remains one of my favorite
            all-time mobile gaming experiences. All love to the console purists, but nothing beats laying in bed during
            the winter break from school and playing GTA III on your phone. </p>
