        <p style="margin:40px;">One of the most underrated installments in the series, I honestly feel bad for this
            game. Painfully, it often gets confused with later, more disliked games, for various reasons. The new
            features this game added were taken a step further by the following title, Black Ops 3. The features were
            taken way too far, however, and BO3 was heavily disliked. I often hear people bring up features that were in
            BO3 as reasons for why they dislike Advanced Warfare and I have here to set the record straight: the only
            new thing in AW was double jump. All that other crap was later games like BO3. I swear 90% of the gaming
            community got hit with a Mandela effect when it came to this. People also often confuse it for Call of Duty:
            Infinite Warfare because of the similar names. IW was another terrible COD game. Long story short, Advanced
            Warfare came at an awkward time in COD. But enough of this game’s sob story. My favorite part about this
            game is the maps. It is definitely in contention for my favorite multiplayer maps of any shooter game.
            Events would happen at a certain point in the match that would change how the map played, like the tsunami
            on the map Defender. There were other events that were unique to maps such as being able to man the giant
            gun on Defender or acquiring alien tech on Site 244. There were so many good maps I can’t name them all:
            Terrace, Sideshow, etc. They also brought back one of my favorite MW2 maps, Highrise, as a new futuristic
            take: Skyrise. The loot system was extremely fun, rewarding, and didn’t cost anything. You got cool new
            clothes and weapon variants just by playing the game. This game has one of my favorite COD stories as well.
            It was unique, had some twists, and the acting was quite good. Kevin Spacey definitely has some issues, but
            he is an amazing villain in this. John Malkovich in the zombies story was also great casting. Finally, I’ll
            end by saying that still to this day, this game has the best looking cutscenes I’ve ever seen. I have no
            clue why no one talks about this, but they blew my mind in 2014 and they continue to look absolutely
            amazing. </p>
