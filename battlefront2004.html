        <p style="margin:40px;">Where to even begin with a game so close to my heart? I have no memory of the first game
            I ever played, probably my Star Wars Plug & Play or some kids game on my grandma’s late-90s Dell. However, I
            do remember the first game I fell in love with. Playing this game everyday after school is one of my
            favorite childhood gaming memories and I can remember so many individual moments from matches in the early
            2000s. I credit this game with getting me into gaming and in my opinion it is the best Large-Scale FPS ever
            released. It has my favorite maps of any game ever. The maps are expertly crafted by developers who clearly
            have a deep love and appreciation for Star Wars and its lore. As a child I wandered the maps endlessly, just
            soaking in the Star Wars content I was so infatuated with. The vehicles in this game are phenomenal.
            Extremely fun to use and effective, yet not overpowered. Newer games often struggle to get this balance
            right in my opinion. While not overly flashy, this game has some of the best premade classes to choose from
            of any game. Each is a uniquely different approach to the game and while I don’t have anything against
            needing to play well to unlock certain classes like in later games, I don’t find myself missing it in this
            one. The simple classes have always been more my speed. Choose from 5 soldiers holding different guns, one’s
            gotta jetpack. I vastly prefer that over something like Overwatch where each person feels like they’re from
            a different universe.</p>
