        <p style="margin:40px;">Bungie took a big risk with this game in a number of ways. It could be argued that Halo
            3: ODST was a bigger risk since it was the first game in the franchise that did not have Master Chief as the
            protagonist. However, I give the developers credit for being willing to follow that up with another game
            that was different. Instead of doing what they thought would make the most money they told the story that
            they were itching to tell. That is when the magic happens. Fans wanted to see Master Chief again and would
            rip into any game without him if given the chance. But they would never get that chance. Halo: Reach is the
            classic example of a game that did everything right. The storyline itself was a risk, but ended up being one
            of the most beloved tales in all of gaming. Every character dies, all your accomplishments are undone,
            nothing you do during the game matters, your only reward is getting to experience the story, yet boy what a
            reward. Few moments in gaming are filled with such emotion as when the whole squad that you’ve been fighting
            alongside the entire game have all perished, only for hundreds of covenant ships to appear in the sky.
            Finally, I’ll wrap up by saying that this game did Forge (or really any Forge-like gamemode) the best of any
            game. I spent so many hours messing around with friends, making bases and launching assaults on each other.
            It is kind of cheating because it is supposed to be a giant blank canvas you can do whatever you want with,
            but Reach’s Forge World is one of my favorite maps ever. It has my favorite Halo aesthetic of massive
            Windows XP-like landscapes with the giant bands of the Halo Ring cutting across the sky. I really hope at
            some point they bring back Forge World with its original look. However, I kind of doubt it since Halo seems
            to be moving in a different direction these days.</p>
