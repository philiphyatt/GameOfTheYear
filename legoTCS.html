        <p style="margin:40px;">When I was a kid, two of my biggest interests were Star Wars and LEGO. It was just my luck that I got to grow up in a time where the two were coming together to create some of the greatest toys ever. LEGO Star Wars products are still coming out today, but the early-2000s sets have such a nostalgic magic to them. How lucky was I that I also got to experience when they brought another one of my interests into the fold, video games. TCS is this triforce of entertainment, realized in its fullest form. The Skywalker Saga is simply just the biggest, most flashy version. The Complete Saga is an action-packed beat-em-up platformer that is a memorable journey through the original perfect saga. It has simple, fun controls that don't overcomplicate things. Rest in peace LucasArts. I liked their version of Star Wars so much better than what has come since their fall. It is hard to put into words with LEGO Star Wars, but take Star Wars 1313 for example. Before LucasArts croaked and it was canceled, the game seemed to be a grounded, realistic take on what living in the universe would be like. Same with the old Battlefront games that felt much more like what clones and stormtroopers would actually go through. The newer games, whether it be LEGO, Battlefront, Jedi, etc. feel so exaggerated and whimsical. It feels weird to describe why I like a game with a rant on newer games, but it's the truth. I like LEGO Star Wars TCS because it is a reminder of the universe that once was. </p>
