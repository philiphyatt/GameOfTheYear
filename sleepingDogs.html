        <p style="margin:40px;">This was the last great single-player story game completely marketed on storytelling and
            fun combat. Newer games always need some sort of special, high tech feature to lean on as a marketing
            crutch. Whether it is destructible buildings, hyper-realistic player customization, or simply a season pass,
            games now do not succeed simply as a narrative-driven experience. This game was truly the last of the
            Mohicans. It is often compared to Yakuza, but to me the biggest difference is it lacks any sort of that
            Yakuza cartoon goofiness. There are no special powers or over-the-top characters, just one man’s mission.
            What makes this game one of the best single player narrative-drive experiences is almost all characters and
            motives being extremely compelling, especially Wei Shen’s. An undercover cop, struggling with doing his job
            the right way while also being pulled deeper into an underworld that is the key to his personal desires for
            revenge. If any game was ever set up perfectly for a movie, it would be this one. Every individual side
            character has such a vibe and personality that they all feel like real factors in this criminal world
            instead of people just walking on screen and saying a line. You feel that you are slowly being indoctrinated
            and brought more into the fold with every crime committed or job completed. I love that this game is not
            afraid to get dark, but never gets overly sad, graphic or gruesome. They tackle some tough topics in the
            story such as suicide, sexual assault, abuse, torture, etc. When most movies/shows/games bring subjects like
            this up, it feels like a cheap way to drum up drama. It usually gives the feeling of: did y’all really need
            to go there? However in this game, they only bring disturbing content up if it actually plays into the
            story. The last thing I’ll mention may seem a little random and strange, but it is something I do appreciate
            about this game. I have never been a fan of sex in video games. It has always rubbed me the wrong way and
            given me the vibes of no-life gamers living vicariously through their game characters. It also often
            functions in a fashion I find rather disturbing. Take Kingdom Come: Deliverance for example, a game I
            actually do really like. For some reason, they decided to include sex and relationships in the game and it
            functions as follows: if every-so-often during your adventures, you come back, visit Theresa, and give her
            gifts such as rings you’ve taken off people you’ve killed, she’ll have sex with you. I don’t like this
            reward system, because it teaches that how to have sex with women is just to give them stuff. Theresa’s not
            a fleshed out character, she simply sits in the same spot every day waiting for you to gift her a ring so it
            can cut to a graphic digital sex scene. In Sleeping Dogs however, there is no minigame to get women to like
            you through presents. Wei simply meets a handful of women over the course of the game who take an interest
            in him and hit on him. The feeling is “ay <u>Wei’s</u> got game,” and not “I got this character to have sex
            with <u>me</u>,” which to me is just a lot less icky. </p>
