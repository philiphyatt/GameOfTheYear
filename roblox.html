        <p style="margin:40px;">I don’t think I have ever watched a game go through as many completely different phases
            as Roblox has. It is like how Fortnite changed from an unsuccessful zombie survival game, to redefining the
            battle royal genre and changing the gaming world, but if they had then switched it up again 3 more times.
            When I started playing as a kid in the early 2000s, it was a goofy LEGO-inspired Minecraft predecessor
            geared around blowing up block structures with cartoon-y explosives. Then I saw it evolve into the golden
            age of Survive the Natural Disasters and Obbies. These were more mechanically complex, yet still fairly
            visually basic. As I got into middle school it was transitioning into what I call, the Era of RP. For a few
            years, every server on Roblox was “High School Roleplay,” “Beach Life Roleplay,” “Work at a Pizzeria
            Roleplay,” etc. This was not as much of my vibe so for a few years I took a break. I also was getting older
            and it was feeling a little weird to be playing with 10-year-olds. Then years later in college, I was told
            by a friend that Roblox had become “insane” with the quality level of games created by players skyrocketing.
            I came out of my Roblox retirement and was introduced into the new world of what is possible in the game
            that is approaching being two decades old. Now, Roblox is essentially just a game engine for people to
            create whatever they want and I have seen some professional-seeming games that I can hardly believe are even
            on Roblox. These eras were the most prominent and widespread, but there were countless other lesser ones
            during my years playing the game. Roblox might be the only game that this is possible with since essentially
            anything is possible and it's completely driven by the players/fanbase and what they want to play. If I had
            to describe Roblox in a single phrase I would say, a truly unique experience.</p>
