        <p style="margin:40px;">While shooter games have long been the most associated with the idea of split screen
            gaming, I believe Rocket League is where that style excels the most. Whether it is competing with friends or
            working alongside them, this game is fun every time. Screenpeaking does not exist, because there is no
            insight you can gain from it. It is all on you to beat the person right next to you. I think a real
            testament to this game is that growing up, none of my friends were into soccer. We were all basketball kids,
            but this game’s new take on the classic sport of football won us all over quickly. This game is easily on
            par with the sports franchises of NBA2k and Madden, but this is just one single game. The absolutely insane
            longevity of this game has kept people playing from when I started 8th grade to a good bit after I graduated
            college. And to be honest, it has much more to do with the quality of the original game than it does with
            new content. The new game modes and features they’ve added are alright, but most still play the classic
            soccer. Another aspect of this game I love is how easy it is to play. It does not take much to run it. I had
            a terrible computer for years that ran just about everything like trash and still this game played
            perfectly. It is also the type of game that takes a lot of skill to be the best, but anyone can pick it up
            and have fun. I don’t play the game that much, but whenever I hop in I’m able to score some goals, win a
            couple games/MVPs, and enjoy myself. The last thing I’ll say is I think it is super cool and user-friendly
            that they allow you to completely change almost anything about the match: ball size, physics, speed, etc.
