        <p style="margin:40px;">While this game does have the word tycoon in the title, I hardly see it as one. I can
            barely remember any building or tycoon mechanics I associate with some of my favorites like Mall Tycoon and
            Zoo Tycoon 2. Instead I remember this game for its snowboarding mechanics that entertained me endlessly as a
            kid. Frankly, I think it just included tycoon in the name because it was a hot word at the time. There was
            Railroad Tycoon, Ski Park Tycoon, Fast Food Tycoon, and many others from the late 1990s and early 2000s.
            This game has become mostly forgotten about, perhaps because of this misleading marketing. The game was not
            quite sure what it wanted to be, but still established a straight up fun foundation. I doubt this game was
            very influential and it likely was a clone in many ways of other snowboarding games at the time. Regardless,
            I still think this game has some unique aspects to it that help it to stand out. Little things like the
            speedometer were fun mechanics not seen in many other snowboarding games. How broken the mechanic was only
            added to the fun factor. I can remember having it regularly say I was going over 80 miles per hour.
            Snowboard and Ski games usually have other people on the courses skiing around and adding to the realism.
            Snowboard Park Tycoon took this one step further and had a skiing yeti that would come by occasionally and
            absolutely smoke you on the slopes. I remember as a kid, desperately trying to catch up in hopes of getting
            a glimpse of the abominable snowman that was tearing the snow up. </p>
