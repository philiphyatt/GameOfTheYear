        <p style="margin:40px;">While the story mode and quests of Shadow of War may not have completely won me over,
            the game's diverse array of features compensates for any narrative shortcomings. The story was far from bad,
            I just found the missions dreadfully boring when compared to the fun of the open-world. They often felt
            lackluster and failed to hold my attention. However, this shortcoming is more than compensated for by the
            game's many multifaceted strengths. Combat stands as one of the game's pillars. The fluid and dynamic combat
            system ensures that every encounter feels like a captivating scene from a top-tier fantasy movie. The thrill
            of dispatching foes with an arsenal of abilities keeps the gameplay feeling fresh and engaging. Special
            mention goes to the teleport kills, a brilliant addition that offers a uniquely enjoyable way to eliminate
            enemies and traverse the map. The inclusion of animal combat and stealth mechanics adds layers of variety to
            the experience. Sneaking through the shadows and shrubbery or utilizing creatures to wreak havoc introduces
            tactical depth, catering to a diverse range of playstyles. Each acquired ability opens up new avenues for
            experimentation, making every encounter a chance to flex your strategic muscles. The heart of the game
            resides within the captivating Nemesis System, which breathes life into the ranks of the orc captains.
            Engaging in battles against these distinct personalities offers a fresh challenge each time, with each
            captain possessing their own unique strengths and weaknesses. I’ve played for years and I don’t think I have
            come anywhere close to seeing them all. The excitement of recruiting new captains is unparalleled, and the
            strategic depth added to the game is simply exhilarating. However, I found it annoying and counterintuitive
            that more and more captains have Iron Will as the game goes on and are unrecruitable. The Siege system is
            another aspect where the game truly shines, capturing the essence of epic warfare. The unpredictability and
            multitude of possible interactions make each siege an enthralling experience. The sheer variety of
            strategies and outcomes ensure that, even after years of playing, new surprises continue to emerge.
