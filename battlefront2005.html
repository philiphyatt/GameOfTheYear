        <p style="margin:40px;">Never will I forgive EA for butchering my boy, Pandemic Studios, just to initially
            resurrect their greatest creation as a horrific microtransaction-filled frankenstein. The game studio behind
            the original two Star Wars Battlefront games was bought and subsequently disbanded by EA shortly after the
            release of this perfect swan song. The first game is still my favorite, but in my opinion, this is one of
            the best sequels to ever come out. I remember when I saw the trailer for this game I absolutely lost my
            mind. I also remember the look on my parents face that said: “Uh oh. Not this again. How is another one
            coming out after only a year?” I still am not sure how they were able to make such a good sequel in only a
            year, but they pulled it off and timed it up perfectly with the release of Revenge of the Sith. For me, this
            game improved upon the first one in a couple of areas, but also took a few steps back. The maps were not
            quite as captivating and detailed and the vehicles were not quite as fun either. Besides this, I don’t look
            at them as better or worse than each other, they just have slightly different gameplay. The classes are
            slightly tweaked and this game introduced a mechanic that would become a staple of the franchise: unique
            classes you have to play well to unlock. This adds a fun aspect of gameplay that isn’t a must for me, but I
            do enjoy it. Of course I have to mention the addition of heroes and villains, which this game does the best
            of any. Later games have become too obsessed with making each hero/villian have starkly unique gameplay,
            like it is Super Smash Bros or something. No star wars fans want that. We don’t want BB-8, we want the Jedi
            Council. Being able to play as Aayla Secura or Ki-Adi-Mundi may be similar to other Jedi, but it is so much
            more fun that way. The same goes for Jango and Boba Fett.</p>
