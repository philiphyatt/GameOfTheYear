        <p style="margin:40px;">Mortal Kombat 11 delivers what is unequivocally my favorite story among all the titles
            in the franchise. However, it's not just the narrative that shines; the characters themselves are given a
            newfound depth, enriching the experience in unprecedented ways. The whole point of the following game was to
            create new, more fleshed-out versions of the classic characters, but I think this game did it before,
            perhaps even unintentionally. The standout feature of Mortal Kombat 11 is its ability to breathe life into
            the characters, it is a delight to witness their growth and evolution as the narrative unfolds. Noob Saibot
            was sort of the Meta Knight of this game, as in extremely overpowered, but I didn't care. Noob in this is
            easily my favorite iteration of any character from the franchise. For me personally, his only competition
            would be Reptile from MK2. Amidst the awe-inspiring hand to hand combat and riveting conflicts, MK11 leaves
            players pondering how the franchise could possibly escalate from its showdown against the god of time. Yet,
            it masterfully plants the seeds for the next game, leaving fans eagerly anticipating what's to come. The set
            up for Mortal Kombat 1 was quite literally, perfect. While the new characters introduced might not match the
            caliber of some from previous games, they remain enjoyable, well-designed, and carry a unique charm. Mortal
            Kombat 11 offers a range of gameplay modes, catering to varied preferences. While I didn't delve into every
            mode extensively, the diverse array of options impressed me, ensuring that players of all tastes could find
            something engaging. I really liked that they brought back the Krypt gamemode, as it is a testament to the
            developers' commitment to the franchise's legacy. It's a nod to loyal fans and adds an extra layer of
            nostalgia and discovery to the game.</p>
