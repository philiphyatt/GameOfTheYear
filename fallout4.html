        <p style="margin:40px;">I have to start this off by saying this was my favorite announcement of any game ever
            and it honestly might just be the flat out best ever. The presentation from Todd Howard himself in 2015 is
            my all time E3 moment. Seeing the player character emerge into the beautiful nuclear forest was absolutely
            breathtaking for me. I got to give this game credit, it was ambitious and willing to take risks with the
            franchise. It was a very different feel than the last two games. Less roleplaying, but with much higher
            quality combat. Voiced protagonist and settlement building were extremely controversial and divisive, but
            god I loved both features. Having a voice allowed my character to fully come to life and settlements allowed
            me to have impact on the desolate world. This game added intricate customization to weapons and power armor
            which was another major improvement to the franchise. The DLC quest lines for this game were some of my
            favorites and I would have gladly traded all the other content-pack-style DLCs for another one of those. I
            loved Far Harbor and Nuka World, but all the workshop addons were a little disappointing for me. I
            personally prefer Skyrim’s follower system of many random brutes and mages you can pick up around the world,
            but FO4’s system is definitely better crafted. Each follower has a district vibe and identity. Many people
            disliked the main storyline, but I thought it was on par with the Elder Scrolls and has the best twist of
            any Bethesda game. The reveal that this mysterious old man was actually your son was quite shocking at
            first. While Skyrim is definitely the game with the most famous modding community, when it comes to weapon
            mods, Fallout 4 blows any other game way out of the water.</p>
